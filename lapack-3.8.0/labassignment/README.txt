Note:

  in the header file, the refernce in the Cblas library is hard coded.

  also in the makefile be sure to change the file path to reflect your lapack directory in under your account on tesla. 

  for example: LAPACKHOME = /home/fgsong/lapack-3.8.0 should be changed to LAPACKHOME = /home/<your username>/lapack-3.8.0
