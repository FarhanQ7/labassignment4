For this assignment I found that creating an algorithm was not the hard part but instead
implementing it with C++ memory management in mind to be the harder aspect.
My goal with this assignment was to keep my code as neat as possible, ie try to
put the least amount of things on the heap. Essentially I just wanted to put the objects
on the heap and immediately delete those objects.

                             My Algorithm
Default step: make class
Step1: make player array
Step2: make base character array with {H,O,R,S,E}
Step3: make random bool generator
Step4: make if statement for hit or misses
Step5: make loop to play game

This is essentially how I went about this assignment. Implementing the code in java was a
simpler, I honestly just took most of the C++ code and simply pasted into the java IDE with
a few minor tweaks, such as the input statement.
